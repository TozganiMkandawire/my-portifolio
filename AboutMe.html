        <h1>ABOUT ME!</h1>
        <img src="pic.jpg" width="400" height="300" class ="center";>
        <P>I am a level 2 student studying bachelor of science in ICT at Mzuzu University. As a goal driven and goal oriented student, I am very passionate to learn all I can in the ICT field. As much as I have only been an ICT student for short while, I have been able to get knowledge about a lot of stuff in the ICT field. So far, I have been able to learn how to program in the C language, JAVA and other programming languages. I have also learnt how to troubleshoot and fix computers as well as maintain them</P>
